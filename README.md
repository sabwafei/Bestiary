Bestiary Application
Link to live project:
##Application for building, editing a bestiary typically used in RPGs
##Task
I wanted to create an application to help me organize my own custom created monsters into an editable bestiary. 
I then wanted to be able to update the bestiary to suit my specific monster needs such as stats (hit points, attack etc.), 
and monster descriptions.
##Tech stack used:
	Java for program logic
	A combination of Scenebuilder, FXML, & CSS for layout and styling

	Import of bestiaries created from an offline source (format permitted)
